### Hi there I'm Mathieu ðŸ‘‹

##### About me ðŸ”­
I'm a French software engineer based in Melbourne, Australia. :fr: :australia:

With a background in Sales and Marketing in FMCG sector, I am good at understanding customer needs and adapting in a fast moving environment.

I have always been curious about the tech industry and I recently started my journey in web development with Le Wagon Melbourne: a 9-week intensive coding bootcamp learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript ES2015, SQL and Ruby on Rails. Towards the end of the bootcamp I developed with my team a Rails prototype of a market place application (www.proudly-aussie.com) which allows local producers to sell their products to anyone living in Australia.

When I am not coding, I love hiking :running:, traveling :earth_africa: and good food/wine :wine_glass:. 

I am now working as a Software Engineer at TallyGroup and as a Teacher Assistant in [Le Wagon Melbourne](https://www.lewagon.com/melbourne). 

##### How to reach me ðŸ“« 

I will be very happy to catch up with you around a beer :beer: or a coffee :coffee:
